# What happens when I visit https://example.com?

1. I type https://example.com in the browser.
2. The browser checks if the IP is cached; if not, it asks DNS to resolve the domain into an IP address.
3. DNS returns the IP address of the server hosting example.com.
4. The browser connects to the serverâ€™s IP using TCP (Transmission Control Protocol), then upgrades the connection with TLS (Transport Layer Security) encryption (HTTPS) on port 443.
5. The browser sends an HTTPS request (GET /) and the server responds with an HTTP response (status, headers, HTML).
6. The browser processes the response, loads extra resources (CSS, JS, images), and renders the web page.
